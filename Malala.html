          <h5 data-aos="slide-right"><strong>Latest News: Malala Yousafzai Calls for Full Cease-Fire in the Israel-Hamas
              War</strong></h5>
          <p data-aos="slide-right">In a November 24 post on X (formerly Twitter), Nobel Peace Prize winner Malala
            Yousafzai welcomed the beginning
            of a temporary cease-fire in the Israel-Hamas war and doubled down on her calls for long-term peace and
            continued aid.
            “Tonight, I feel relief for the women, children and young people reunited with their families, and for the
            pause in the bombardment of Gaza,” she wrote.
            “We must keep speaking out for [children in Gaza]—for a full ceasefire and more humanitarian aid. The
            needless suffering must end.” </p>
          <p data-aos="slide-right">The 26-year-old began advocating for peace in the region soon after the conflict
            began on October 7.
            She witnessed violence while growing up in Pakistan and became a target, herself, surviving an assassination
            attempt as a teenager,
            after speaking up against the Taliban’s prohibition on girls’ education. Last month,
            Yousafzai said she donated $300,000 to three charities helping Palestinians and encouraged the public to
            sign a petition demanding Israel
            stop attacking schools and both sides release their child hostages.</p>

      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1500">Malala Yousafzai, often known simply as Malala, is a Pakistani
        girls’ education activist
        who survived an assassination attempt at age 15 and became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize in
        2014.
        Yousafzai began advocating for girls’ education when she was still a child, which resulted in the Taliban
        issuing a death threat against her.
        In October 2012, a gunman shot Yousafzai when she was traveling home from school. The activist survived, became
        a Nobel laureate at age 17,
        and continues her work through her international nonprofit, Malala Fund. She has written several books,
        including the best-selling memoir I Am Malala, and helped produce the 2022 Oscar-nominated documentary short
        Stranger at the Gate.

      <h1 data-aos="slide-right"><strong>Shot by the Taliban </strong></h1>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1000">On October 9, 2012, when 15-year-old Yousafzai was riding a bus
        with friends on their way home from school,
        a masked gunman boarded the bus and demanded to know which girl was Yousafzai. When friends looked toward her,
        Yousafzai was given away. The gunman fired at her, hitting the girl in the left side of her head; the bullet
        then traveled down her neck.
        Two other girls were also injured in the attack.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1400">The shooting left Yousafzai in critical condition, so she was
        flown to a military hospital in Peshawar.
        A portion of her skull was removed to treat her swelling brain. To receive further care, she was transferred to
        Birmingham,
        England, which became her family’s new home.</p>
      <img src="malal images/Malala images/malala6.avif" alt="Malala Yousafzai" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1500">Malala Yousafzai, seen here with her father and two younger
        brothers weeks after she was shot,
        spent most of her recovery at a hospital in the United Kingdom.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1600">Once she was in the United Kingdom, Yousafzai was taken out of
        a medically induced coma.
        Although she would require multiple surgeries—including repair of a facial nerve to fix the paralyzed left side
        of her
        face—she had suffered no major brain damage. In March 2013, she was able to begin attending school in
        Birmingham.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1700">The shooting resulted in a massive outpouring of support for
        Yousafzai that continued during her recovery and today. Although the Taliban still considers Yousafzai a target,
        she remains a staunch advocate for the power of education.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1800"><strong>Nearly two years after the attack, Pakistani
          authorities arrested 10 Taliban militants for their part
          in the assassination attempt. Most were acquitted in April 2015 due to lack of evidence, meanwhile two men
          were convicted and sentenced
          to life in prison. Ehsanullah Ehsan, the alleged shooter who is also connected to other terrorist activities,
          was arrested in February 2017 but escaped custody in early 2020.

      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1100">Nine months after being shot by the Taliban, Yousafzai gave a
        <strong>speech at the United Nations</strong> on July 12, 2013—her 16th birthday.
        It was her first speaking in public since the attack. Yousafzai highlighted her primary causes
        of education and women’s rights, while urging world leaders to introduce peace and prosperity, as well as fund
        mandatory
        education for all. She encouraged other activists to continue speaking out and appealed to individuals to end

      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1500">Two months after Yousafzai was shot, UNESCO and the Pakistan
        government
        created the Malala Fund for Girls’ Education. Then, in 2013, Yousafzai and her father launched the similarly
        named
        nonprofit, Malala Fund, that works to ensure girls around the world have access to 12 years of free and safe
        education.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1600">The nonprofit primarily supports its Education Champion
        Network—previously known as its Gulmakai Network,
        a reference to the pseudonym Yousafzai used when she wrote for the BBC—of local activists in places where many
        girls don’t
        receive secondary education. The network has grown to include 10 countries: Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Brazil,
        Ethiopia, India,
        Lebanon, Nigeria, Pakistan, Tanzania, and Turkey.</p>
      <h5 data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1700"><strong>“The shocking truth is that world leaders have the
          money to fully fund primary AND
          \secondary education around the world—but they are choosing to spend it on other things, like their military
          budgets.
          In fact, if the whole world stopped spending money on the military for just eight days, we could have
          the $39 billion still needed to provide 12 years of free, quality education to every child on the planet.”
        </strong></h5>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1800"> In January 2018, Apple announced it was partnering with Malala
        Fund
        to help provide education to more than 100,000 girls around the world.
        The company pledged to contribute money and technology, as well as assist with curriculum and policy research.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1900">According to the Malala Fund website, the organization has
        <strong>invested more than $47 million</strong> in total across its various programs.</p>

      <h1 data-aos="slide-right"><strong>Return to Pakistan </strong></h1>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1100">Through all her activism, Yousafzai remained committed to her
        own education.
        She graduated from Edgbaston High School for Girls in Birmingham, England, in July 2017.
        She continued her studies at Oxford University that fall.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1100">On March 29, 2018, the Oxford student returned to Pakistan for
        the first time since her brutal 2012 attack.
        Not long after arriving, Yousafzai met with then–Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and delivered an emotional
        speech at his office.
        “In the last five years, I have always dreamed of coming back to my country,” she said. “I never wanted to
        leave.”
        Yousafzai also visited her former home and a military-run cadet college in Mingora during her four-day trip.</p>

      <h1 data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1200"><strong>Husband</strong></h1>
      <img src="malal images/Malala images/malala14.avif" alt="Malala Yousafzai" class="img-fluid rounded shadow">
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1100">While attending Oxford in summer 2018, Yousafzai met Asser
        Malik, who was visiting friends on campus.
        Despite Malala’s reservations about marriage—she said in a 2021 essay she believed she wouldn’t marry until she
        was at least 35 years old,
        if at all—the pair wed in November 2021 in Birmingham.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1200">In addition to their educational backgrounds—similar to
        Yousafzai,
        Malik earned a degree in economics and political science in 2012—the pair have bonded over their mutual love of
        cricket.
        Malik works for the sport’s governing body in Pakistan and is the co-founder of an amateur league.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right" data-aos-duration="1300">Yousafzai said in 2021 her time together with Malik helped her
        see that she could “remain true to my values of equality,
        fairness, and integrity” while simultaneously being in a relationship.
        “I still don’t have all the answers for the challenges facing women—but I believe that I can enjoy friendship,
        love, and equality in marriage,” she told British Vogue. </p>
      <h1 data-aos="flip-up"><strong>Quotes</strong></h1>
      <p data-aos="slide-right">Let us pick up our books and pens. They are our most powerful weapons.</p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right">If I win [the] Nobel Peace Prize, it would be a great opportunity for me, but if I don’t

        is to see the education of every child.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right">Dear friends, on the 9th of October, 2012, the Taliban shot me on the left side of my
        forehead. They shot my friends too. They thought that the bullets would silence us, but they failed.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right">I want people to remember that Pakistan is my country. Even if its people hate me, I
        will still love it.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right">I am only talking about education, women’s rights, and peace. I want poverty to end in
        tomorrow’s Pakistan. I want every girl in Pakistan to go to school.
      </p>
      <p data-aos="slide-right">I am still the old Malala. I still try to live normally, but yes, my life has changed a
        lot.
